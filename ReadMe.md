# Baseball Card Game Simulator
This is a python version of a tabletop game I previously designed, in which two teams create a lineup of baseball cards to face off.
Play the game on the website: [Here!](https://baseball-card-simulator.streamlit.app/)

## priority to-do list
- develop into a website where the game is playable
    - currently the website is super slow - fix that [FIXED]
    - also, the advance bases function is not working [IT WORKS!!!]
    - when those two things are fixed, try allowing the player to change the stats of the batters and pitchers
    - annoying bug where stats did not immediately change when inputted [FIXED]

## Goals
- Create the ability to input lineups with statistics
- Save previously inputted players for future games
- Create gameplay mechanics through random number generators and player statistics [DONE]
- Record player statistics and include a leaderboard
- Develop into an app or website using the streamlit package [DONE]

## Skills Learned
- how to use classes, global variables, list manipulation, and a lot more nit-picky stuff
- basic development with streamlit
- using basic math formulas to create a sports simulation
- how to not smack my head on a wall when I keep getting bugs because I rush through streamlit without really knowing how it works

## not priority to-do list
- add in statistic lists
- add fatigue for pitchers
- add player substitution
